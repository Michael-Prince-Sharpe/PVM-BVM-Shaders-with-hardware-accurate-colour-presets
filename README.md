This shader preset is intended to be used in RetroArch to look as it appeared on the original systems as if they were hooked up to a consumer Sony Trinitron BVM/PVM television unit. It's recommended to place this shader in the directory \RetroArch\shaders

This shader was put together by using crt-consumer and adjusting the settings to remove curvature and uneven grill patterns that loked awkward. This shader makes classic consoles look as they were originally intended and match the hardware outputs for each classic console to the Sony Trinitron.
