# Sony-Trinitron-PVM-BVM-Shader-Presets
These shader presets are intended to be used in RetroArch to look as they appeared on the original systems as if they were hooked up to a Sony Trinitron BVM/PVM monitor. It's recommended to place these shaders in the directory \RetroArch\shaders or \RetroArch\shaders\shaders_slang\crt

These shaders were put together by using crt-guest-advanced and adjusting the settings to match the hardware outputs for each console to the Sony Trinitron.
These shaders are intended to be viewed in 4k but for lower resolutions just lower the Crt Mask Size to 1.00x and for resolutions higher than 4k then the CRT Mask Size should be above 2.00 to 3.00 or 4.00 accordingly.
