# PVM-BVM-Shaders-with-hardware-accurate-colour-presets
These shader presets are intended to be used in RetroArch to look as they appeared on the original systems as if they were hooked up to a Sony Trinitron BVM monitor with RGB hardware colors. It's recommended to place these shaders in the directory \RetroArch\shaders or \RetroArch\shaders\shaders_slang\crt

These shaders were put together by using crt-guest-advanced and adjusting the settings and gamma to match the hardware RGB outputs for each console.
